Semantic search across a few Oscar Wilde works

- RAG-powered search app that surfaces verbatim passages from all six Oscar Wilde books using natural language queries
- Semantic search via pgvector (HNSW index) and Voyage AI embeddings stored in Neon PostgreSQL
- AI-synthesized summaries grounded in retrieved passages via Anthropic Claude API
- Custom data ingestion pipeline fetching, cleaning, and chunking ~6,500 paragraphs from Project Gutenberg plaintext files
- Drizzle ORM for schema and queries; raw SQL for vector similarity search
- Rate limiting with Upstash Redis to protect open endpoints
- Built with Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Shadcn UI, and Tailwind CSS, deployed to Vercel

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
